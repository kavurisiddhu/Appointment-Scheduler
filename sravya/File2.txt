Branch naming conventions

Use grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names.
Define and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
Do not use bare numbers as leading parts.
Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches
